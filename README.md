#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software Engineering is the process  and practice of applying engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems. It enables the creation of software applications that power modern life such as medical systems, aircrafts, telecommunications among others.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

In the early days,  software development was done by small teams writing code on their own experiences and knowledge. 
In the 60s and 70s development of formal methods for software design and development such as structural programming and use of flowcharts to represent algorithms were developed.
In the 90s, emergence of Agile software development methodology emphasised on flexibility and responsiveness to change.
Software Engineering has grown and matured over time with new technologies and approaches being developed to improve the design  and development of software 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning:In this phase,the purpose and scope of the software is defined and is crucial in fostering effective communication and collaboration within the team.
Requirement Analysis: The team identifies and records the precise requirements of the final user and this information results in a document called requirement specification document which outlines the software's purpose, features  and functionalities,  acting as a guide for the team and providing cost estimates if needed.
Desigh: Here the framework is built with emphasis on outlining the software's structure, navigation, user interfaces and database design ensuring that it is user friendly  and performs its tasks efficiently. This phase is the link between purpose and execution. 
Coding: Software design is converted into tangible code with developers using appropriate language to write code with the aim if developing software that is functional,  efficient and user friendly. 
Testing: Here, a thorough investigation of the software for any bugs or glitches that slipped through to ensure flawless software operation before it reaches the end user. 
Deployment: This encompasses rolling out the meticulously tested and fine tuned software to end users and signifies a shift from project phase to production phase where the software begins to fulfil its purpose. 
Maintenance: This deals with constant assistance and improvements which guarantees software's best possible functionality and longevity.  It encompasses frequent updates, implementing patches and fixing bugs while also considering long term strategies such as upgrading and replacing software. 


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

The Waterfall methodology is linear and sequential with a rigid structure  suitable for projects that require  strict regulatory requirements such as military software while Agile methodology is iterative and incremental characterised by short development cycles and continuous feedback and is suitable for projects with uncertain/evolving requirements such as blockchain technology and social media apps.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

The Software Developer is responsible for designing, coding, and implementing software solutions. The Quality Assurance Engineer is responsible for ensuring the quality of the software product. The Project Manager is responsible for overseeing the entire software development project.



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

An IDE is a software application that provides a comprehensive set of tools for software development that enables the user to carry out activities such as code editing,  debugging  and version control system integration. Examples include VScode and Vim.
A VCS is a software tool that tracks changes to a set of files over time allowing developers to collaborate on projects efficiently, manage different versions of code, and revert to previous states if necessary. 
Examples include Git and Mercurial. 
These tools are paramount in enhancing the efficiency, productivity, and collaboration of software development teams.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Balancing quality and speed while adhering to project deadlines. Using time tracking techniques as well as prioritising critical tasks as well as writing clean code can mitigate this challenge. 
Keeping up with the rapid pace of technological advancements. This can be mitigated by continuous learning to development better skills and joining tech communities so as to stay abreast. 
Maintaining a healthy work-life balance. This can be solved by cultivating time management skills, performing self care such as exercises and socialising as well as discussing flexible work schedules with the employer if possible. 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing is done to verify the correctness of individual units of code. Its importance include identifying defects early in the development process, improving code maintainability and reusability and facilitates regression testing
Integration testing is done to verify the interaction between different units or components of the software. It is done by testing the interfaces between subsystems. It ensures that components work together as expected and helps identify integration-related issues.
System testing evaluate the entire system as a whole against specified requirements. It is done by testing the software against system-level requirements, including functionality, performance, and security.
Acceptance testing is done to verify that the software meets the customer's or user's requirements. It is done in a real-world environment or production-like conditionsand serves to ensure that the software delivers the expected value to the end-user and obtains customer approval before deployment




#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting effective prompts to interact with artificial intelligence models so as to improve the quality and relevance of the AI response. It enables the user to harness the full potential of the AI models and archive better results

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Write a letter to my boss" can be improved by asking "Imagine you are an employee requesting to go on leave from 2nd September to 8th September because you would love to visit your family foryour annual leave,  write a formal letter to the manager called MrJohn Doe outliningthe instructionson continuationof delegated duties". This prompt specifies a particular topic and gets to the point of the content.
